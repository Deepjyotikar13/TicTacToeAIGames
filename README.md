# TicTacToeAIGames
This tic tac toe ai games has 2 folder one that has 3x3 tic tac toe another that has 4x4
So I made a Tic Tac Toe AI using Python. In this code you will find two folders: one that has a 4x4 Tic Tac Toe and another that has a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe. And wait in the 3x3 version i have two games: one that can be played in your terminal and another that is in GUI version btw the logic of the code is simple not that complicated just that my code is a little messy
